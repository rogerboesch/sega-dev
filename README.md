# SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive Development

I plan to work on a bigger project/game in 2025 for the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis in US).

More to come ...


## VSCode template

In [SEGA_VSCode](SEGA_VSCode/) you find the VSCode template I use. The base template is from [this repo](https://github.com/pleft/SEGA_VSCode_Template), 
but I **customized** it for my needs.

Press **CTRL**-**SHIFT**-B to compile or **CTRL**-T to execute the available tasks

- task *build*: compile the project
- task *clean*: clean the project
- task *run*: run the code in emulator (Needs installation of the [gems kmod emulator](https://gendev.spritesmind.net/page-gensK.html))
 
Feel free to use, it's a nice starting point for every project.
